### PROJECTS
#### WAR ANALYSIS
I used the dataset from Kaggle to visualize the losses of the Russian army over 2 years in Tableau.
Here we can see the biggest losses of the Russian army in Ukrainian cities. 
There are also linear graphs showing how many cruise missiles and drones were shot down day by day. 
In addition, there is a similar chart to see the losses of aircraft and helicopters. 
There are also charts which calculate losses of different equipment over three years: 2022, 2023, and 2024. 
There is also a count of days, personnel, and a sum for shot down cruise missiles and drones.

In addition, I added the ‘Deep State Map’ to visualize the current front line of the war.

All the charts are interactive.

#### SALES ANALYTICS
I used the dataset from Power Query, cleaned the data, and added additional columns for visualization. 
This dashboard shows the monthly sales trend by countries and products.
Here, you can see the count of gross sales, sold units, total profit amount, and the percentage of profit ratio. 
There are also tables to showcase how many units were sold and how much money was earned, depending on the product type and segment.
Besides, there is a large graph to visualize the gross sales and profit ratio month by month. 
Moreover, I added a chart to see the highest earnings by countries and a pie chart to visualize the total amount of every possible discount.
